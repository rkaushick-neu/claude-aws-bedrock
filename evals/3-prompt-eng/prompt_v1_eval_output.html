                <td class="output"><pre>For a person with Type 2 diabetes training for a marathon, here's a suggested meal plan focused on supporting their 15km training runs while maintaining stable blood sugar:

Before Run (2-3 hours prior):
- Steel-cut oats with cinnamon (low glycemic index carbs)
- 1-2 tablespoons of nut butter for sustained energy
- Small apple or berries for natural sugars
- Protein source like egg whites

During Run:
- Natural energy sources like banana or dates (test during training)
- Water with electrolytes (no artificial sweeteners)

Post Run:
- Lean protein (chicken, fish, or tofu) for muscle recovery
- Complex carbohydrates like sweet potato or quinoa
- Green vegetables for nutrients
- Healthy fats (avocado, olive oil)

Throughout Day:
- Small, frequent meals to maintain blood sugar
- High-fiber foods (legumes, vegetables)
- Lean proteins
- Healthy fats
- Whole grains in moderated portions

Key Considerations:
- Monitor blood glucose before, during, and after runs
- Time carbohydrates carefully around exercise
- Work with healthcare provider to adjust medication if needed
- Stay well-hydrated
- Keep a food/blood sugar log to identify optimal timing and portions</pre></td>

Breakfast (1000-1200 calories):
- 2 cups of oatmeal with honey
- 2 bananas
- 4 tbsp almond butter
- 1 cup mixed berries
- Toast with jam
- Orange juice

Mid-Morning (500 calories):
- Rice cakes with honey
- Dried fruits (dates, raisins)
- Sports drink

Lunch (1200 calories):
- Large portion of white rice
- Grilled lean chicken breast
- Steamed vegetables
- Avocado
- Sports drink

Pre-Training Snack (500 calories):
- White bread with jam
- Energy gel or sports chews
- Banana

Dinner (1200 calories):
- Lean fish or chicken
- Sweet potato or pasta
- Steamed vegetables
- Olive oil
- White rice

Evening Snack (400 calories):
- Rice cakes
- Honey
- Banana

Key points:
