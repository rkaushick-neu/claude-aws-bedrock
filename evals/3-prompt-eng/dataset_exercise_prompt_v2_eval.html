Drawing on Surrealist artistic movements while reflecting broader cultural anxieties about industrialization, these experimental films challenged traditional class hierarchies through their radical formal techniques. The films' disruption of linear narrative mirrored contemporaneous sociological theories about the fragmentation of urban experience, while their integration of abstract imagery drew from both working-class music hall traditions and elite gallery practices, effectively blurring established cultural boundaries.</td>

As noted by Wilson (2020), "media coverage of extreme weather events has significantly increased climate awareness among urban populations" (p. 45). The intersection of social media discourse and traditional news reporting has created new pathways for environmental messaging, while psychological barriers to climate action persist despite improved scientific literacy (Brown et al., 2022).</td>

Our methodology involved collecting water samples from three coastal regions over a 12-month period. The findings indicate significant accumulation of plastic particles in filter-feeding organisms. We conclude that microplastic concentrations correlate strongly with decreased biodiversity in affected areas. Furthermore, the research suggests potential biomagnification of these pollutants through the food chain.</td>
